- Events were moved from one global Event namespace to their respective namespaces, eg `Flarum\Event\UserWillBeSaved` > `Flarum\User\Event\Saving`
- FloodGate has been made extensible
- JavaScript Components
  - icons
    - with the `icon()` helper now need full declaration from `cog` to `far fa-cog`
    - in elements that have an `icon` property need the same new declaration (buttons with images fi)
    - no longer support font awesome 4, all icons have to be from 5 (free version)
    - this also means the `-o` "open" modifier on some icons has been removed for the preferred strong, regular, light alternatives
