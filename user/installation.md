Flarum utilizes Composer to manage its dependencies and extensions. So, before installing Flarum, you will need to install Composer on your machine. To do this, enter into the command line:

### Ubuntu
  sudo apt-get install composer

Once Composer is installed you'll then need to run this command in the location where Flarum should be installed:
