## FAQ

- __When will the next release be available?__
  The development team aims to release a new version every 6 weeks. Hotfix releases can however 
  be released outside of this cycle and can push other versions or features back.
- __My forum is in maintenance mode?!__
  Flarum is automatically placed in maintenance mode when you've updated the code, but not the database
  yet. To update the database either open your admin page or run migrations using the `flarum` terminal
  command `php flarum migrate`.
