## Filename formatting

Documentation filenames are always in lowercase and have the extension `.md` indicating it's a markdown file.

## Content formatting

The documentation uses markdown for formatting. You can check this [cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) for reference.

> Please do not use raw html in these pages.

## Placeholder links, texts

In case links or texts are not yet available or applicable, use the following:

### Links

Use the value `link-to-something` where something is a meaningful value. We can later on search the docs for the value `link-to-` to see where we need replacements.

### Texts

For texts that should be added, add `((missing))`. In case the text is not yet applicable use `((future))` in front of the text and `((endfuture))` after it.
