## Technologies

Before we get started, there’s something you should be aware of: Flarum uses some modern languages and tools. If you’ve only ever built WordPress or Drupal plugins before, you might feel a bit out of your depth! That’s OK — this is a great time to learn cool new things and extend your skillset. Below is a list of the technologies that Flarum uses, as well as some links and resources you might find useful:

   - **Object-oriented PHP**. Classes, namespaces, and autoloading. Laracasts has a [great series] (https://laracasts.com/series/object-oriented-bootcamp-in-php/episodes/1) on this.
   - **Laravel components**. Specifically, [Database] (http://laravel.com/docs/5.1/eloquent) and [Validation] (http://laravel.com/docs/5.1/validation).
   - **JavaScript, ES6, and JSX**. Learn about [ES6 features] (http://git.io/es6features) and [JSX syntax] (https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-in-depth.html).
   - **Mithril.js**. Only a [basic understanding] (http://mithril.js.org/getting-started.html) is necessary.

Don’t fret if you get stuck – there are plenty of people on the [Community Forum] (http://discuss.flarum.org/t/extensibility) and [Gitter Chat] (https://gitter.im/flarum/flarum) who are more than willing to help.
