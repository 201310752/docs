## User Handbook
### Registration

To be able to post, and interact with a Flarum powered community, you'll first need to register yourself a user account. The registration process could not be easier, and takes only a few moments of your time.

You can find the Sign Up button generally located at the top right hand of your screen, which looks like this:

Once you click the Sign Up button, you should be presented with a screen that looks like this:

Flarum has a few authentication options you can use, such as Facebook, GitHub and Twitter accounts.

**Username** - This will be your member account name, it will be displayed on all the posts you make and the discussions you start, aswell as your profile page. You may have to try a few names depending if your username is already taken by another party.

**E-Mail** - This will be an e-mail account of your choosing linked to your Forum account, you will need to provide a valid, working email address otherwise it may hinder your ability to use the site at all.

**Password** - This is the desired password that you wish to use to authenticate yourself as the account owner, it is good practise to use a secure password (There are many guides on the internet to help with this).

Once you click on Sign Up, you may need to click on a link sent to the e-mail address you provided to validate that the e-mail account is yours, and that you have access to it.
