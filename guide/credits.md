Arkinn is the author of this User Handbook, many hours spent writing, screenshotting, filming (gifs), tweaking, polishing and perfecting!

Webeindustry for his help in the server install guides, his many hours spent helping me perfect the installation method we used for Flarum. A huge thanks to him.

Kulga for his help in the method of creating animated gif's that have been used numerous times in the user handbook. Again a huge thanks to him.

I will update this page as and when others contribute to the documentation writing process.
