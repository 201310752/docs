## User Handbook
### Searching the Forum

Flarum has a powerful, easy to use forum search feature, to which you can search for post content, users and mentions.

At the top of your screen, you'll see a box with _Search_ written inside, you can use this box to search for almost anything you want on the forums. For example, in the screenshot below I searched for posts, user and mentions for the user 'Franz'

Click on either the User, or the Posts to be taken directly to them.

It's as easy as that!

If you want to see more results, click on the top result "Search all discussions for 'Franz'" and that will happen.
