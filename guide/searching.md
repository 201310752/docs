## User Handbook
### Searching the Forum

Flarum has a powerful, easy to use forum search feature, to which you can search for post content, users and mentions.

At the top of your screen, you'll see a box with **Search** written inside, you'll notice that this will do a search for discussions **AND** users all in the same box when you type.

## Searching for a Forum User

You can locate user accounts by simply typing their **username** in the search box, the section for this will be clearly labelled **Users** as the below animation will show you:

Clicking on the name of the user you wish to view will take you directly to their profile.

## Searching discussions for content

Flarum allows you to search all discussions, and all replies (including titles) for keywords depending on your search, in the example below I have searched for the keyword _free_, as the below example will show you, it will list 3 discussions where that word is present and apply a bold font to the word(s) so they stand out.
