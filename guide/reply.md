### Making a Reply to a Post

Making a reply to a post is a very simple process.

From the screenshot below, there are 2 ways to make a reply, one of those ways is to click on the large blue **"Reply"** button to the right hand side of the screen, alternatively at the bottom of the screen, there is a box wth **"Write a Reply.."** inside.

Clicking either of those, will bring up the reply box, where you can type your response in.

Once you have finished writing what you want to say, then go ahead and click "Post Reply" which wil make your post immediately visible on that thread, and allow anyone to reply to you.
