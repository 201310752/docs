### Making a Reply to a Post

When you want to make a reply, there are 2 things you will want to consider, are you replying to the **THREAD** it's self, or are you making a reply to **someone's comment**? either way there is a difference, we'll tell you (and also show you) the differences between the two.

## Making a reply to the Thread

Using this method will create a fresh reply, with no mentions or ties to any other comment on the page (Unless you insert them manually).

To do this:

 - Click on the **Reply** button to the right of the page, above the infinity scroller.
 - Once the reply box displays, type your desired response to the thread.
 - Click on the **Post Reply** button at the bottom left of the box.
 
You will see your reply go live almost immediately for both you, and everyone else to see. The below animation will also show you visually how it's done.

## Making a reply to another user's reply

This particular method is used for when you wish to reply to a comment made by someone else, this will automatically create a tie to their reply and will notify the person that their comment has recieved a response (Depending on their personal preference settings) in case they wish to in turn respond to you.

To do this:

- Hover to the bottom of their post to bring up the **Reply** link
- Once the reply box displays, type your desired response to the thread.
- Click on the **Post Reply** button at the bottom left of the box.

Again, once you've done this, your comment will go almost immediately live for all to view, and a notification (if they have allowed) will be immediately sent to their notification area.
