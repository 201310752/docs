## Flagging user content

Every now and then content that you think is breaking the rules needs to be looked at by a Moderator/Admin. This is super-easy to do with Flarum so let's get started.

Firstly, find the post that you wish to flag, then click on the _Post Menu_ to reveal the **flag** button. Click that and the box below will display.

We need to let the Moderators know why this post is being flagged, you can select from the 4 radio buttons displayed, these are currently:

![SS - Report a post options](687474703a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f464f57594b42782e706e67.png)

- **Off-topic** this option is for anything not related to the subject being spoken about.
- **Inappropriate** for anything that is not appropriate for the forum, such as nudity, bad language etc.
- **Spam** self-explanatory really, but could be things like advertising, nonsense typing or filling many discussions with the same post.
- **Other** in case the category for the flag is not listed, you can type your own reason for flagging the post. 

Once you've selected the appropriate radio button, click **Flag Post** which will immediately send the alert to the Moderators.
