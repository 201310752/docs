### Flagging user content

Every now and then content that you think is breaking the rules needs to be looked at by a Moderator/Admin. This is super-easy to do with Flarum so let's get started.

Ok, so now we've found the flag function, we need to let the Moderators know why this post is being flagged, you can select from a drop down menu of 3 items, these are currently:

(( Future: screenshot of flag options ))

**Off-topic** this option is for anything not related to the subject being spoken about.
**Inappropriate** for anything that is not appropriate for the forum, such as nudity, bad language etc.
**Spam** self-explanatory really, but could be things like advertising, nonsense typing or filling many discussions with the same post.
**Other** in case the category for the flag is not listed, you can type your own reason for flagging the post. 

Once you've selected the appropriate radio button, click **Flag Post** to send the alert to the Moderators.
