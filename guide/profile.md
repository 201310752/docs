## User Handbook
### Your Profile

Flarum has a basic profile system, in your profile there are 3 different categories of your profile that you can view.

 - Posts
 - Discussions
 - Mentions

**Posts** will allow you to see a 'Timeline view' of posts that you have made in any discussion you have access to, starting from the most recent at the top, to the older at the bottom.

**Discussions** allows you to see what discussions you are currently participating in, for example have either started, or made a reply in. Again this is most recent at the top, to the older at the bottom.

**Mentions** this will list any posts that have mentioned you by username (starting with @), most recent mentions start at the top, to the older at the bottom.

Your profile page also has a "Settings" tab, this allows you to change your password, e-mail address.

The Notifications section on the profile page is a little more featured, as it gives you the opportunity to define how you wish to be notified about certain events.

If the **Web** option is _Ticked_ then any event listed with that tick will appear in your notification area once triggered

If the **Email** option is _Ticked_ then the event trigger will dispatch an email to you once it's triggered.
