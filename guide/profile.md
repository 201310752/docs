You can see an example of how the look in the screenshot below:

### Settings

Your settings page contains the ability to change your Password, and e-mail address (which you can see in the screenshot below). You are also given the option to change how you wish to be notified about certain events. Each one is configurable for both notification area, and e-mail. 

#### Notification Key

 - The **Red "X"** means that the event selected will **NOT** trigger a notification.
 - The **Green Tick** means that the event selected **WILL** trigger a notification.
 - The **Grey "X"** means that the event **cannot** be triggered at this time.
 
You are able to change this at any time simply by clicking on which event you wish to use, for example, if you wanted to receive an email whenever someone mentions you with the @ symbol in the forums, then **clicking that icon** making sure it is a **Green Tick** will activate that setting. Each time you click an icon, it will automatically save that preference for you.
