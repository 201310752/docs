## User Handbook
### A glossary of terms used in the documentation, and their explanation

This part of the document is to give you a better understanding on what certain terms said throughout the documentation mean. You can refer to this at any time you are uncertain of anything.

#### Discussion
This is a brand new 'thread' or 'discussion' which creates the initial post for people to reply to.

#### Post
A post is found at the very start of a discussion, and also any subsequent replies users make. A post is the content that you as a user write in contribution to a particular discussion or thread.

#### Mention
A mention is activated by typing @(username) anywhere in your post (obviously replacing 'username' with the username of the person you wish to mention). This will create a link to that person's user account, and will also notify them that they've been mentioned when they next login (or straight away if they are already online). This function is designed to bring a post or thread to someone's attention.
