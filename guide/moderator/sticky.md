### Sticky/Unsticky a thread

To either Sticky, or unsticky a thread, hover your mouse over the right side of the thread, which will bring up the three dots, click that to reveal the thread menu. As show below in the menu, go ahead and click on **Sticky** which will attach a Pin to the thread, and force it to remain at the top of the home page.
